# Ezra Buckingham's Blog 

This repository contains all the code for my blog. It is a Hugo-based static site generator that uses GitHub Actions to deploy the site to a custom domain. Cool stuff IMO.

MAIN URL: ezrabuckingham.com
URL: ezra-buckingham.github.io

## Develop

To run the development server:

```bash
hugo --config config.yml server -D
```

## Create a New Post

To create a new post, you can use the following command:

```
hugo new blog/test.md
```

Note: I use 20 x 5 aspect ratio for pictures. This can be done in Photos.

## Comments

Comments use an external third-party. I have no idea what I am doing.

## Acknowledgements
